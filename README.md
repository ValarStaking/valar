# Valar

Welcome to [Valar](https://stake.valar.solutions) - a decentralized platform for connecting blockchain stakeholders to node runners that offer direct participation in blockchain consensus, i.e. staking.
The platform is based on the peer-to-peer direct staking approach.
Details about the platform can be found in [Valar: Platform Overview](Valar-Platform-Overview.pdf).

The platform consists of three parts:
1. [Valar Smart Contracts](./projects/valar-smart-contracts/README.md) (core)
2. [Valar Daemon](./projects/valar-daemon/README.md) (optional)
3. [Valar User Interface](./projects/valar-user-interface/README.md) (optional)

The project is developed using [AlgoKit](https://developer.algorand.org/algokit/).
The smart contracts are written in [Algorand Python](https://github.com/algorandfoundation/puya).
The daemon is written in Python.
The user interface is written in React.js TypeScript with Tailwind CSS.
For details about each part, see the corresponding `README.md` files.

A public test deployment instance of the smart contracts is available on `Algorand fnet` (ID: [`16318962`](https://lora.algokit.io/fnet/application/16318962)).
